# Yuri's Notes

This fork is compatible with both the ESP32 and ESP8266.

Because the ESP8266 has some idiosyncrasies with its hardware serial ports, I used SoftwareSerial to implement the ESP8266 bridge.  It is limited to ~115200 baud and will likely prove less reliable than an ESP32. `BLUETOOTH` (hardware limitation) and `PROTOCOL_UDP` (software limitation) are not available on the ESP8266.

As is, the sketch will compile, build, and upload without errors for the ESP32.  Edit `config.h` to configure and build for ESP8266.

There are many configurable parameters in `config.h`. Edit to suit your needs - inline comments should provide clarity.

## Major update, Apr 2023:
* Fixed compatibility with Arduino framework 2.0
* Added compatibility with PlatformIO.
* Implemented `PROTOCOL_UDP` (UDP broadcast)
* `PROTOCOL_TCP` and `PROTOCOL_UDP` can be used simultaneously, though doing so may result in serial traffic conflicts if your client connections are not managed carefully.
* Added `ESP32-Serial-WiFi-Client.ino` in a separate sketch folder to make an ESP32 TCP or UDP client that connects to the ESP-Serial-Bridge. Edit `client_config.h` and upload to a second board.
* Multiple bugs (possible buffer overruns) are fixed in the latest commit(s).
* Latest commits also include some styling/readability edits, though I can easily admit that it isn't the "prettiest" of C++ projects.

# ESP32-Serial-Bridge

Transparent WiFi (TCP) to all three UART Bridge, supports both AP and STATION WiFi modes. The .ino file is the code for the ESP32. Use Arduino IDE for ESP32 to compile and upload it to the ESP32.
I made this project in order to connect Flight equipment devices devices like (Radio, Vario FLARM), to a Flight Computer (Kobo, Smartphones etc.),  but it is not limited to that. You can use it wherever you want, but on your own risk. Read license file for more details.

In some cases the memory layout is to small for this sketch.

If you face this problem you can either disable Bluetooth by removing `#define BLUETOOTH` in `config.h` or change the partition size as described here:

## Wiring
```COM0 Rx <-> GPIO21                                                                               
COM0 Tx <-> GPIO01                                                                                 
COM1 Rx <-> GPIO16                                                                               
COM1 Tx <-> GPIO17                                                                              
COM2 Rx <-> GPIO15                                                                               
COM2 Tx <-> GPIO04```

**Note:** The PIN assignment has changed and may not look straigt forward (other PINs are marke as Rx/Tx), but this assignment allows to flash via USB also with hooked MAX3232 serial drivers.

I recomend to start your project with a Node32s or compatible evaluation board. For a TTL to RS232 level conversion search google for "TTL RS3232 Converter"
